Enterprise-style Agentic AI Assistant demonstrating planner–executor–memory workflow, decision logic, and safe escalation. Designed for AI training and interview demonstration using synthetic data.
# Enterprise Agentic AI Assistant

## Overview
This project demonstrates an **Enterprise-style Agentic AI Assistant** that follows a structured **Planner → Executor → Memory → Decision** workflow.

Unlike traditional chatbots, this system is designed to **plan tasks, execute actions, store context, and decide when to escalate**, closely mimicking how real enterprise AI agents operate.

This project is built using **synthetic data** and is intended for **training, interviews, and concept demonstrations**.

---

## Why This Project?
Most enterprise AI systems require more than simple question–answering.

They need AI that can:
- Break complex problems into steps
- Execute actions systematically
- Remember previous actions
- Escalate safely when confidence is low

This project demonstrates those **core Agentic AI principles** in a simple, explainable way.

## Key Concepts Explained (Beginner Friendly)

### Agentic AI
An AI system that can **decide what to do next**, not just generate responses.

### Planner
Breaks a user request into logical steps.

### Executor
Performs each step decided by the planner.

### Memory
Stores previous actions and outcomes to maintain context.

### Escalation
Stops automation and hands over to a human when uncertainty is high.
